# PERMUTOOLS
PERMUTOOLS is a statistical software package for multivariate permutation testing in MATLAB. By comparing the magnitude of the test statistic of interest with those obtained using permutations of the data, it provides powerful, distribution-free hypothesis testing. Family-wise error rate is controlled using the maximum statistic method, making it suitable for multivariate or multiple permutation tests. PERMUTOOLS offers a range of test statistics including the t-statistic (paired, unpaired), the F-statistic (unpaired), the correlation coefficient (Pearson, Spearman), as well as measures of effect size with bootstrapped confidence intervals (Cohen's d, Hedges' g, Glass' delta).
